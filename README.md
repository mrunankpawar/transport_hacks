# QUIZZY TRANSPORT

## Inspiration 💡 
Our aim at the Transport Hacks Hackathon is to revolutionize transportation education with our innovative AR quizzes. We believe that learning about transportation rules, supply chain management, and shipping goods should be engaging and accessible to all. Our solution not only makes learning fun but also empowers individuals and businesses with essential knowledge for a seamless and sustainable transport ecosystem.

## What it does 🧠
As of now we have curated 3 different AR experiences targeting different domains like public transport, goods shipping and the supply chain industry. It allows user to interact and learn about the rules or play around with friends and family using the latest and trending Augmented Reality technology. We have developed quizzes, and fun social experiences.

## How we built it 🛠️
We built it using Figma and Canva for developing the assets and Meta Spark Platform for building the social AR experiences for Facebook and Instagram. We have curated all these quizzes and fun AR experiences under one roof using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Challenges we ran into 💪🏼
We had tough time completing the project as we had to develop and publish the effects within the hackathon timeframe. And also in addition to that curating it on the website was what took some time, but we are happy that we were able to make it and overcame the challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are super proud that we were able to complete the project on time and all three of our AR experiences got published within the timeframe on both Facebook and Instagram. 

## What's next for Quizzy Transport 🔮
In the future we plan to add in more and more experiences taking Augmented Reality to next level, where you could actually augment different modes of transport in the real world and teach small kids about different modes of transport and this will be an effective and interactive learning for all the kids.
